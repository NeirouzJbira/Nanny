      <h2 id="big-subtitleparent">OUR SCREENING PROCESS</h2>
      <p id="paragraph-subt">We follow a rigorous screening process to vet the qualifications and 
        background of everyone we invite to join our selective community. 
        We review over one hundred applications per week and interview a select number 
        of applicants in person at our Union Square offices. Upon a successful interview, 
        we speak with a minimum of two child care-related references, conduct background 
        checks, and finish with an evaluation from a SmartSitting Director to ensure that 
        they are best matched with SmartSitting families. We believe that nanny  hires 
        should be treated with the same level of professionalism as corporate hires.</p>
